# Algorithms

---

An algorithm is a sequence of steps followed to solve a problem.<br/>
Algorithms can be grouped under three classes:<br/>

1. **Divide & Conquer:** Divides the problem into sub-parts and solves each one separately.

2. **Dynamic Programming:** Divides the problem into sub-parts, remembers the results of the sub-parts and applies it to similar ones.

3. **Greedy Algorithms:** Involves taking the easiest step while solving a problem without worrying about the complexity of the future steps. <br/>
