# Algorithms

An algorithm is a sequence of steps followed to solve a problem.
Here are a few classes of algorithms:

1. **Divide & Conquer:** Divides the problem into sub-parts and solves each one separately.

2. **Dynamic Programming:** Divides the problem into sub-parts, remembers the results of the sub-parts and applies it to similar ones.

3. **Greedy Algorithms:** Involves taking the easiest step while solving a problem without worrying about the complexity of the future steps. 
   
4. ****Brute** Force algorithm:** Straightforward methods of solving a problem that relies on sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency. 

5. **Recursive algorithm:** Solves a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 

6. **Backtracking algorithm:** It is a refinement of the brute force approach, which systematically searches for a solution to a problem among all available options. 

7. **Randomised algorithm:** It makes use of probabilistic analysis and employs a degree of randomness as part of it's logic or procedure. The algorithm typically uses uniformly random bits as an auxiliary input to guide its behavior, in the hope of achieving good performance in the "average case" over all possible choices of random determined by the random bits; thus either the running time, or the output (or both) are random variables.
