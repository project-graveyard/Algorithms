# Sorting Algorithms
* **Bubble sort:** It is a comparison algorithm that first compares and then sorts adjacent elements if they are not in a specified order.
* **Insertion sort:** It picks one element of a given list at a time and places it at the exact spot where it is to be placed.
* **Merge sort:** It follows the divide and conquer rule. The given list is first divided into smaller lists and compares adjacent lists and then, reorders them in a desired sequence.
* **Selection sort:** It divides a given list into 2 halves where the first half is the sorted list and the second half is the unsorted list. At first, the sorted lost is empty and all elements to be sorted are in the unsorted list. The algorithm looks at all the items in the unsorted list, picks up the item that comes first and repeats the process and places the element of the new item to the right of the sorted list.
